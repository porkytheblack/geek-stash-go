# GEEK-STASH-GO
Taking go out for a spin. 

## What is this?
Re-implementation of [geek-stash](https://github.com/porkytheblack/geek-stash) in go.

⚠️ This is a work in progress. ⚠️

still under construction, but test api active on https://geek-stash-go-production.up.railway.app will add other handlers and documentation eventually 😁
